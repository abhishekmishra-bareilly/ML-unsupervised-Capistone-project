**1- Data Overview**
  * We have 7787 rows and 12 columns provided in the data.

  * In the dataset we have 11 object columns and 1 integer column as release_year.

**2- Checking the null values**
  * Fist we have 2389 null values in director column.We have almost 30% null values in this column so we can not use this column in model training but we can use it in EDA.

  * We have 718 null values in cast column. and it can be replaced with 'unknown'.

  * we have 507 null values in country column.Replacing nulls with 'mode'.

  * Also we have 10 null values in date_added column.we have few rows of date_added so we can 'drop' these rows.
